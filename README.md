# Graph Reconstruction Attention Fusion Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis
This is a project about GRAFN
## Introduction
The development of social media has made Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) a hot research field. The MSA aims to analyze human emotions in videos using three modalities: vision, acoustics, and language. Most of the previous studies focus on the feature extraction of the data itself, ignoring the structural information between/within the multimodal data. The proposed GRAFN model effectively combines sequence features with structural information to improve the performance of MSA.
## Highlight
1.	An advanced MSA network is proposed to unit graph learning with sequence learning.
2.	A module based on the K-means is designed to reconstruct graph representations.
3.	An architecture is proposed to promote the text-guided multimodal fusion process.
4.	A structure is raised to adjust the sensitivity of features for downstream tasks.
